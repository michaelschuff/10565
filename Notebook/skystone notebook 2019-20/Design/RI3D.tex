\section{Robot in 3 Days}

After the Skystone challenge was released, we brainstormed ideas and came up with a design for a prototype that we could make with mostly parts we already had.

\par \textbf{Drivetrain:} We will be using the drivechain that we chose over the summer, the goBilda drivetrain.

\par \textbf{Intake:} stuff about the intake

\par \textbf{Belted Virtual 4-Bar Linkage:} 

\par Building a prototype robot in 3 days helped us learn a lot about some of the difficulties involved in this year's challenge, which will help us a lot moving forward. By getting a first prototype completed quickly, we have a better understanding of what will and won't work.
