\subsection{V2.0}

\par \textbf{Compliant Intake:} We were having problems with the intake swinging around when we rotated, so we used stronger springs in this version, which should help keep the pods in the right place.

\par \textbf{Compliant Wheels:} We still have four compliant wheels total, but the two on the outside of the robot have a diameter of 3in and the others have a diameter of 2 inches. The 3 inch wheels have more surface area and grip on the Stones and are significantly better at intaking them. The 2 inch compliant wheels at the top of the intake ensure the Stone moves completely and quickly to the outtake system.
