\section{Intake}
\subsection{V1.0}
The intake has two compliant pods to intake Stones quickly and efficiently.
\par \textbf{Compliant Intake:} Each pod is mounted on an axle, allowing it to swing back and forth. Once springs are attached, the pods will move around and intake Stones in more orientations than a static intake would.

\par \textbf{Compliant Wheels:} Our intake has 2 pairs of 2 inch compliant wheels with one pair on each side. The compliant wheels allow for a little bit of error in the position of the pods, so when a Stone does come in, it will be intaken even if the pods aren't in the optimal position. The compliant wheels also allow us to squeeze the Stone harder to give us more grip it.
