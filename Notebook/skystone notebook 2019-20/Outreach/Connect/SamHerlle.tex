\subsection{Sam Herlle - guest speaker}

\outreachEntry{10/18/19}{Connect}{Josh, Michael}{}

\textbf{Summary:} Sam Herlle works in construction, specifically as an electrician, on automated windmills, and came in today and talked to the club about his job. A noticeable difference between what he did and what we do is the size of the windmill. On average the windmills are about 300-350 feet tall, and each blade can be over 100 feet long. These massive blades move at very high speeds at the tip, so although they appear to be moving slow, the tip can be moving at upwards of a hundred mph.
